I love pull-requests. However, this repo is just a mirror of [redactor-js official website](http://redactorjs.com/) hosted here for your, my dear GitHubbers, convenience.

Thus, no pull-requests will be accepted and there's very low chance original authors will look at the issues.

Sorry about that.

# problems
 * options tag doesnt support any  style except firefox so the dropdown showing font-family not   work.
 * custom embed need api to fetch data of the url(then only we can render)


# Ideas
 * getCurrentNode() -- function gives you the caret placed element.
 * jquery closest to find the closest tags.
